### Any install instructions necessary to get the project running

After cloning, or downloading the zip:

### The number of hours you spent working on this

I had three work sessions totally up to just under **5 hours**

No additional *features*, but did implement a lovely UI with color changing buttons (the color is calculated using the movie's comp image using Chamilion).

#### Known bugs

I couldn't find a higher resolution url for the movie's image
